Ans 1: Because we were essentially doing the same code but for different outcomes.
	 It can be problematic because if a bug arises in the first one, it will most
	 be passed on to the second one as well.

Ans 2: Not any I can think of currently.

Ans 3: I was familiar with constructors and getters/setters but I had to look up some
	 methods such as Math.PI or the indexOf method.

Ans 4: We would have to redefine all the parameters and rewrite all the code from scratch
	 for it, it will also make the code longer, more complex and more prone to bugs.
