 Answers to last part of the lab. 
		 * a) Java primitive types are passed by value where as objects are passed by reference
		 * 
		 * b) When a primitive type is passed to a method, it is passed by value so any
		 * changes made to the variable in the called method are not seen in the calling
		 * method.
		 * 
		 * c) When an object is passed, the object is passed by reference. Therefore
		 * changes made to the object in the called method are available in the calling
		 * method after the called method returns.
		 * 
		 * d) Scope of objects passed to a method is always global. Changes are
		 * preserved in the same object
