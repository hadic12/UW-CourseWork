                                                    How to guess

I guess by first starting at 50 as it is the middle value, whether its too high or low does not matter as the 
strategy is the same to approach from both sides. Then I decrease the gap by 20, still too high or low so but if 
it changes from being high to low or vice versa, I change the gap to 10, then 5 and so on till I guess right. Usually 
takes around 5 guesses to reach the conclusion or 3 is often but not frequent. My best was 1st try when I just was tired 
and randomly guessed 96.
